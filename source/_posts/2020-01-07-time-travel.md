**client** : *Get me to `Done`.*  
**michelle** : *Let's do it. How do we get there?*  
**client** : *Here it is. You can get there however you want.*  
**michelle** : *Really? That whole big space close to where we are now?*  
**client** : *Yep. Just get there.*  
--*Later*--  
**michelle** : *Huzzah. We made it.*  
**client** : *No. That's `Not even close`*  
**michelle** : *Weird. This was `Done` not too long ago. There must have been some civil war on our way here.*  
**michelle** : *Ok. Now we're there.*  
**client** : *What? No. That's `Worse than before.`*  
**client** : *`Not quite.`*  
**client** : *Nope.*  
--*Later*--
