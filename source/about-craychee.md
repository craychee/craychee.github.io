Nothing about "I built my first computer in fortran when I was 6" here. No I-joined-my-first-hacker-space-in-college-and-now-I-am-hooked tale. I was a liberal arts enthusiast through-and-through up until one day in grad school when, while tearing open yet another manuscripts sent through the post to the academic journal that I worked for, I thought: *I think the Internet could make this easier.*

From that moment on, this thought is my constant companion.

I am Engineer now. I look for things to make us go.

My last name, **Krejci**, is pronouced `cray'chee`. Like "crayon" and "cheetah" or like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray" rel="nofollow">supercomputer manufacturer</a> and the fictional race of andriods from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154147/" rel="nofollow">*Animorphs*</a>. You decide.
